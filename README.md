AI-Powered Meeting Notes Summarizer: Approach, Process, and Tech Stack
1. Approach
The primary goal of this project is to develop a full-stack application that allows users to upload meeting transcripts, generate summaries using AI, edit the summaries, and share them via email. The approach focuses on creating a functional and user-friendly application with a simple and intuitive interface.

The application will be built using a modern tech stack that is both powerful and easy to work with. The frontend will be developed using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, which will allow for a fast and responsive user interface. The backend will be built with Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and scalable server-side solution. For the email sharing functionality, EmailJS will be integrated into the frontend, simplifying the process of sending emails without the need for a dedicated email server.

The AI-powered summarization will be handled by an external AI service, which will be accessed through an API. The user will be able to provide a custom prompt to guide the AI in generating the summary, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and control over the output.

The application will be deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform that is well-suited for hosting modern web applications. Vercel's seamless integration with GitHub will allow for continuous deployment, making it easy to update the application with new features and bug fixes.

2. Process
The development process will be broken down into the following stages:

Project Setup: The first step is to set up the project structure, including the frontend and backend directories. The frontend will be initialized using Vite with the React template, and Tailwind CSS will be configured for styling. The backend will be set up as a Node.js project with Express.js as the web framework.

Frontend Development: The frontend will be built with a focus on user experience. The main components will include a file upload form for the meeting transcript, a text input for the custom prompt, a display area for the generated summary, and an email sharing form. The user interface will be designed to be clean and intuitive, with clear instructions and feedback for the user.

Backend Development: The backend will be responsible for handling the AI summarization and email sharing. It will expose an API endpoint that accepts the meeting transcript and custom prompt as input, and returns the generated summary. The backend will also handle the integration with the AI service, sending the user's input to the AI and returning the response to the frontend.

AI Integration: The AI integration will be a key part of the application. The backend will use an AI service to generate the summaries, which will be accessed through an API. The user's custom prompt will be used to guide the AI in generating the summary, allowing for a high degree of customization.

Email Sharing: The email sharing functionality will be implemented using EmailJS. The frontend will include a form where the user can enter the recipient's email address and a custom message. When the user clicks the "Share" button, the frontend will use EmailJS to send the summary to the recipient.

Deployment: The final step is to deploy the application to Vercel. The frontend and backend will be deployed as separate services, with the frontend configured to communicate with the backend API. Vercel's continuous deployment feature will be used to automatically deploy changes to the application whenever new code is pushed to the GitHub repository.

3. Tech Stack
The following technologies will be used to build the application:

Frontend:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast and modern build tool for web development.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

Express.js: A web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs.

Email:

EmailJS: A service that allows you to send emails directly from your frontend without the need for a backend.

Deployment:

Vercel: A cloud platform for hosting modern web applications.

This tech stack was chosen for its flexibility, performance, and ease of use. The combination of React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS allows for a fast and responsive frontend, while Node.js and Express.js provide a powerful and scalable backend. EmailJS simplifies the process of sending emails, and Vercel makes it easy to deploy and host the application.
